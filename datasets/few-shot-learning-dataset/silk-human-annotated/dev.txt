min( mongeelkanSimlarity(?x/p:producer, ?y/p:producer), ratclifDisitance(x/p:city,y/p:city))	The link will be generated if the labels of the source and the target have minimum mongeelkan simlairty or the cities of the source and the target have minimum ratclif distance
Average( max(cosineDistance(?x/p:affiliation, ?y/p:organizationName), trigramsSimilarity(x/p:simplification,y/p:elucidation)), max(soundexDistance(?x/p:definition, ?y/p:interpretation), jaroSimilarity(x/p:streetAdress,y/p:locationAdress)))	The link will be generated by calculating the average similarity of the maximum value of cosine distance between the affiliation of the source and the organizationName of the target or trigrams similarity  between the simplification of source and the elucidation of the target and the maximum value between soundex distance between the definition of the source and the interpretation of the target or jaro similarity  between the streetAdress of source and the locationAdress of the target
