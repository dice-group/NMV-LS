max(jaccardSimilarity(?x/p:label, ?y/p:label)1.0, wgs84(x/p:coordinates,y/p:coordinates))	The link will be generated if the labels of the source and the target have maximum jaccard Similarity or the coordinates of the source and the target have minimum wgs84
min(levenshteinDistance(?x/p:label, ?y/p:label)1.0, wgs84(x/p:coordinates,y/p:coordinates))	The link will be generated if the labels of the source and the target have minimum levenshtein Distance or the coordinates of the source and the target have minimum wgs84
