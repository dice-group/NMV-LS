max(overlapDistance(?x/p:country, ?y/p:state), doublemetaSimilarity(x/p:brotherof,y/p:siblingssOf))	The link will be generated if the country of the source and the state of the target have maximum overlap Distance or the brotherof of the source and the sibilingsof of target have maximum doublemeta similarity
Average( min(diceDistance(?x/p:EducationalOrganization ?y/p:insisitutionName), qgramsSimilarity(x/p:description,y/p:explanation)), max(koelnSimialrity(?x/p:about, ?y/p:comment), DaitchMokotoffSimilarity(x/p:title,y/p:name)))	The link will be generated by computing the average similarity of the minimum value of dice distance between the EducationalOrganization of the source and the insisitutionName of the target or qgrams similarity  between the description of source and the explanation of the target and the maximum value between koeln similarity between the about of the source and the comment of the target or DaitchMokotoff similarity  between the title of source and the name of the target
